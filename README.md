# Quantum Walks

Project
---
There are three parts to this project. The first part is to make a complete implementation of Grover's algorithm and test it.

The second part is to generalize this implementation to quantum walks and further find applications for these types of algorithms. This part should focus on building a general algorithm, as a higher-order function, to make other types of search algorithms on arbitrary datasets.

Aim
---
TThis project aims to establish a foundational knowledge of quantum algorithms and quantum walks. Quantum walks over arbritrary graphs will be studied.
