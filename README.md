# Quantum Walks

Project
---
There are three parts to this project. The first part is to make a complete implementation of Grover's algorithm and test it.

The second part is to generalize this implementation to quantum walks and further find applications for these types of algorithms. This part should focus on building a general algorithm, as a higher-order function, to make other types of search algorithms on arbitrary datasets.

The third part of this project is to look at applications of these algorithms to post-quantum cryptography. The focus will be in particular with searching over isogenies used in the SIKE algorithm, and solving the shortest vector problem.

Aim
---
This project aim to test the implementation of quantum walks with different cryptographic attacks. We will explore some quantum attacks on systems like SIKE (isogenic based cryptography) and NTRU (lattice based cryptography) for post-quantum cryptography.
